  <h2>Competitive Gaming</h2>
  <p>"I played Valorant on my high school esports team. Started gaming in my early teens, fell in love with it. Being part of the team was a blast â€“ competitive matches, strategy, and great friends. Good times!"
  </p>
  <p>As of now, I don't play much; just trade stocks.</p>

  <h2>Stocks</h2>
  <p>I started trading forex and indices in October 2023, became somewhat good at it, and liked it.</p>

  <h2>Reselling</h2>
  <p>Got into reselling at a young age, first selling shoes just to make an extra buck.</p>
